!!Exercise!!
If you still find yourself using the arrow keys to navigate around Vim in normal mode, map them to <nop> to make yourself stop.

If you still use the arrow keys in insert mode, map them to <nop> there too. The right way to use Vim is to get out of insert mode as soon as you can and use normal mode to move around.
